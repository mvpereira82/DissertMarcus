abstract = {The potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements to investigate gas and liquid distributions within a fixed-bed reactor operating in co-current downflow in the trickle-flow regime is demonstrated. Liquid holdup and wetting efficiency are studied for a range of gas (66–356mm/s) and liquid (0.5–5.8mm/s) superficial velocities. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance images have been acquired for flow within a packing of 5mm diameter glass ballotini contained in a cylindrical column of internal diameter 40mm. The images are of sufficiently high resolution to be able to characterise liquid rivulets within the bed and to detect the presence of thin water films on the surfaces of the packing elements. As expected, liquid holdup and wetting efficiency increase with increase in liquid flow rate, at a fixed gas flow rate. A transition in the holdup and wetting characteristics is observed at a liquid superficial velocity of 1.5–2mm/s. The number of liquid rivulets increased rapidly as the liquid superficial velocity was increased from 0.5 to 2.0mm/s and then reached a plateau; the increase in liquid flow as the liquid flow rate was further increased was taken up in the increasing size of existing rivulets. Differences in the nature of the liquid distribution within the bed are also reported for different conditions of prewetting of the packing. Gas flow rate affected the onset of flow instabilities but not the liquid distribution. 3-D MRI data enabled the visualisation of the extent of liquid filling of individual ‘pores' within the inter-particle space as a function of liquid flow rate, and how this depended on the ‘pore' size. For each packing element, the fraction of the surface area that was wetted was found to correlate with the number of contact points that packing element made to other packing elements within the bed.},

A first-order kinetics approach proved valM for the bauxite-based catalysts, having a wide pore size distribution, provided that the hydrodynamic effects in the reactor had been suitably accounted for by either external liquid holdup or apparent intrapartlcle diffusivtty. In contrast, the results from the alumina catalyst required interpretation with a different model, probably because of the different pore size distribution.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamics of trickle-bed reactors involve complex interactions of gas and liquid phases with packed solids. Such complex interactions manifest in different flow regimes occurring in trickle-bed reactors. Knowledge of prevailing flow regime, pressure drop, and liquid holdup is essential for design and performance evaluation of the reactor. Detailed knowledge of fluid dynamics is essential for “a priory” predictions as well as for interpretation of available data. In this study, we have used wall pressure fluctuation measurements to identify prevailing flow regime in trickle beds. Experiments were carried out on two scales of columns (of diameter 10 cm and 20 cm) with two sets of particles (3 mm and 6 mm diameter spherical particles). Effects of prewetted and unwetted bed conditions on pressure drop and liquid holdup were reported for a range of operating conditions (VG ) 0.22-0.44 kg/m2s, VL ) 2-24 kg/m2s). A comprehensive CFD model was developed to predict measured hydrodynamic parameters. The model was evaluated by comparing predictions with the experimental data. The CFD model was then extended to predict the fraction of liquid holdup suspended in the form of drops in the bed. At the end, the CFD model was used to understand hydrodynamics of trickle beds with periodic operation. The experimental data as well as computational models discussed here will have significant implications for understanding and designing of trickle-bed reactors.},

abstract = {Trickle bed processes belong to the most widely used multiphase reactors and are applied on a large scale particularly for hydrotreatment of medium heavy and heavy oil fractions in the hydrocarbon processing industry. Laboratory scale reactors used in the development of new processes or in studies aimed at improving existing ones should therefore give accurate and meaningful test results which allow reliable upscaling. For reasons of efficiency in R{\&}D, the size of the laboratory test units should be as small as possible without detracting from the meaningfulness of the data. The present paper discusses scaling rules of laboratory trickle bed reactors and the influence of scale parameters on residence time distribution and catalyst contacting under conditions that are typical for hydrotreatment of oils. The main limiting factors for downsizing of laboratory trickle-bed reactors are the distortion of the packing in the vicinity of the wall, axial dispersion and flow through the packing, and uneven catalyst irrigation By dilution of a bed of catalyst particles with inert material of a much smaller particle size, it is possible to obtain kinetically representative data in very small laboratory reactors, viz., microflow reactors containing about 10 mL of catalyst.},

The varying parameters are liquid viscosity and density, gas density, bed particle shape and size. The range for gas density range is particularly large (from 1.3 to 30kg/m3), thanks to the use of dense gas to simulate very high pressure conditions. This data bank has been first used to compare the prediction accuracy of the different models from the literature. Finally, the mechanistic model proposed by Attou et al. [1999. Modelling of the hydrodynamics of the cocurrent gas–liquid trickle flow through a trickle-bed reactor. Chemical Engineering Science 54, 785–802] has been improved by adding a new formulation for liquid film tortuosity in two-phase flow conditions. This model has been validated over the whole data range and the accuracy has been checked with data external to the data bank.

The need to purify cuts rich in olefins or diolefins, to achieve the purity level required for producing improving qualities of polymers and elastomers, has led to the development of great many hydrogenation processes and catalysts and to great improvements in scientific knowledge in the field of catalytic hydrogenation. The possibilities of cracking and polymerization technologies have as yet been only partially exploited. Therefore, further progress in hydrorefining is necessary, and the selective hydrogenation of hydrocarbons continues to be improved and diversified.},

In this study a phenomenological analysis has been developed to relate the wetting efficiency with operating conditions such as reactor pressure, gas and liquid flow rate. Experimental data for the wetting efficiency at high pressure have been obtained via a tracer technique. The data support the developed model which can be expressed by the following correlation: ƞCE = 1.104 REL1/31 + [($\Delta$PZ)/pLg]GaL1/9 This correlation is also in good agreement with the data correlated previously at atmospheric pressure and provides the means for assessing liquid-catalyst contacting at all operating pressures.},

@article{Jakobsson2004,
abstract = {Countercurrent operation of trickle-bed hydrogenation reactors has advantages over the commonly used co-current operation mode in some specific cases. The advantages evolve from one of the basic practices applied in chemical engineering, i.e. the countercurrent operation utilizes the available mass transfer driving force between gas and liquid phases to its maximum and thus drives the conversion to its limit. In reactors this also provides the means to strip light components from the liquid phase. These light compounds might inhibit the reaction or poison the catalyst. The modelling of hydrogenation processes is a challenging task not only because of the various hydrodynamic aspects involved but also in respect of the mass transfer processes between liquid and vapour, liquid and catalyst and sometimes even inside the catalyst particles. Countercurrent operation is mathematically complex. The solution is an iterative process and setting boundary values can be a problem whereas co-current operation can be solved easily as a group of partial differential equations with known initial values. In this paper we utilize the so-called rate-based approach to countercurrent hydrogenation reactors and show some of its features. Comparison with co-current process has been done additionally and the efficiency of countercurrent operation in removing of light compounds has been shown.},

Therefore, an alternative discrete model has been developed, that is closer to the reality of a packing than the hitherto existing models, but at the same time more flexible. Contrary to the dispersion models as well as the cell mdoels, the new model accomplishes all basic preconditions formulated by Sundaresan et al. for models to cope adequately with the phenomena in fixed bed reactors. The new model is applicable to single phase as well as multiphase packed bed reactors with complex fluid dynamics. Its ability to simulate experimental results is demonstrated for the heterogeneous catalytic gas-phase oxidation of methanol on a Fe/Mo-oxide catalyst.},

abstract = {One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) cell network models were developed to simulate the steady-state behavior of trickle-bed reactors employed for the highly exothermic hydrotreating of benzene. The multiphase mass transfer-reaction model and novel solution method are discussed in this report. The 1D model was shown to satisfactorily simulate the axial temperature field observed experimentally for multiphase flow with exothermic reactions. The 2D reactor modeling provided valuable information about local hot spot behavior within the multiphase reactor, identifying situations in which hot spots may form. The model took into consideration the heterogeneous nature of liquid distribution, including radial liquid maldistribution and partial external wetting. This approach was proven to be stable and efficient in dealing with the complex interaction of phase vaporization and temperature rise. Through analysis and discussion, this report established the cell network model as a valid representation of the flow environment produced in a trickle bed with exothermic reactions.},

In the past trickle bed reactor models for various reaction systems were validated with pilot plant data but the development of a dynamic model based on industrial data is rare. Kittisupakorn and Arpornwichanop (1999) have recently developed a steady state model of an industrial trickle-bed reactor for the above system. However, this model is only applicable to predict steady state conditions and inapplicable to design startup and shutdown as well as control studies. Therefore, in this work, a dynamic model of an industrial trickle-bed reactor for describing the hydrogenation reactions of a pyrolysis gasoline in an olefin plant has been developed based on actual plant data. The model results to a set of partial differential equations which were solved by method of lines with approximate spatial derivative terms by an orthogonal collocation method. The model was used to study the response of the process. The simulation results demonstrated that the dynamic response gave a reasonable path from a transient to steady state condition. This dynamic model will be used in future in the formulation of model based control strategies in order to control the reactor.},

Experimental tests were carried out based on the analysis of the response curves of the reactor to a step decrease of the tracer inlet concentration. The pore filling of the catalyst pellets was practically total even at very low liquid flow rates, probably due to capillarity. The external effective wetting was interpreted in terms of an apparent internal diffusivity (Di)app, determined on the basis of a model which assumes a total external wetting of the catalyst. The values of (Di)app increased with the liquid flow rate, tending to the actual internal diffusivity Di determined in a full reactor. The found values of (Di)app/Di were used to interpret the ratio of the apparent kinetic rate constant determined in a trickle reactor kapp and that for a totally wetted catalyst kv. The calculated values agree substantially with those proposed by Satterfield[3] from kinetic tests.},

A dynamic plug-flow heterogeneous one-dimensional model, which has been previously validated with experimental data obtained in an isothermal pilot plant reactor with cocurrent operation, was employed to compare both modes of operation. The reactor model considers the main reactions present in the hydrotreating process: hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrodearomatization. Simulations were performed for both pilot and commercial trickle-bed reactors, and the results are discussed in terms of variations with time and axial position of partial pressure, temperature and concentrations in liquid phase. A superior performance of countercurrent operation mode was found over cocurrent mode. It was recognized that countercurrent mode can have great potential to be used for deep hydrodesulfurization of oil fractions since it minimizes the inhibiting effect of some products (e.g. H2S) in reactor zones where these species tend to concentrate in cocurrent operation, i.e. at the bottom of the catalytic bed.},

abstract = {A model is developed based on a two-stage hydrogenation of pyrolysis gasoline to obtain a C6-C8 cut suitable for extraction of aromatics. In order to model the hydrogenation reactors, suitable hydrodynamic and reaction submodels should be solved simultaneously. The first stage hydrogenation takes place in a trickle bed reactor. The reaction rates of different di-olefines as well as hydrodynamic parameters of the trickle bed (i.e., catalyst wetting efficiency, pressure drop, mass transfer coefficient and liquid hold-up) have been combined to derive the equations to model this reactor. The second stage hydrogenation takes place in a two compartment fixed bed reactor. Hydrogenation of olefines takes place in the first compartment while sulfur is eliminated from the flow in the second compartment. These reactions occur at relatively higher temperature and pressure compared to the first stage. The key component in this stage is considered to be cyclohexene, of which the hydrogenation was found to be the most difficult of the olefines present in the feed. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression was adopted for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene and its kinetic parameters were determined experimentally in a micro-reactor in the presence of the industrial catalyst. The model was solved for the whole process of hydrogenation, including hydro-desulfurization. The predictions of the model were compared with actual plant data from an industrial scale pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation unit and satisfactory agreement was found between the model and plant data. {\textcopyright} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {The vast majority of commercial trickle-bed reactors, fixed bed of catalyst particles contacted by cocurrent downflow of gas and liquid, operate at high pressure. In this study Holubet al.'s (1992, 1993) phenomenological model has been extended to describe the effect of high pressure (i.e. increased gas density) on pressure drop and liquid holdup in the trickle flow regime. This model, based on annular two-phase flow in a slit, ties pressure drop and liquid holdup but was previously verified only at atmospheric pressure. The advantage of this model is that the Ergun constantsE1 andE2, required by the model, are determined from single phase (gas) flow through the packing of interest and no two-phase flow data is needed. Experiments were conducted at high pressure over a range of gas and liquid velocities and different bed characteristics. The developed phenomenological analysis, describing the effect of high pressure and gas flow rate in terms of five limiting cases, matches well the experimental observations. The high pressure data collected in this study was used as a basis for comparing the prediction for pressure drop and liquid holdup of the model and of the available high pressure correlations. Holubet al.'s (1992) model matches experimental observations better than available correlations. It also predicts all trends in pressure drop and holdup correctly for all changes in operating variables such as pressure, liquid and gas superficial mass velocity and with physical properties of the gas and liquid.},

The general relation between diffusivities in dilute liquid solutions and solvent viscosities for non-complexing systems was reviewed.

Niether the temperature, nor solvent molecular weight or molar volume was required to describe the observed relationship between the diffusivities and solvent viscosities for eleven different substances, for a range of temperatures, solvents and binary solvent compositions.

abstract = {A modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state is proposed. Vapor pressures of pure compounds can be closely reproduced by assuming the parameter a in the original equation to be temperature-dependent. With the introduction of the acentric factor as a third parameter, a generalized correlation for the modified parameter can be derived. It applies to all nonpolar compounds. With the application of the original generalized mixing rules, the proposed equation can be extended successfully to multicomponent-VLE calculations, for mixtures of nonpolar substances, with the exclusion of carbon dioxide.

In this tool the consistency of measurement units, system solvability and initial conditions consistency are automatically checked. The solvability test is carried out by an index reduction method which reduces the index of the resulting system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) to zero by adding new variables and equations when necessary. The index reduction requires time derivatives of the original equations that are provided by a built-in symbolic differentiation system. The partial derivatives required during the initialisation and integration are generated by a built-in automatic differentiation system. For the description of processes a new object-oriented modelling language was developed. The extensive usage of the object-oriented paradigm in the proposed tool leads to a system naturally CAPE-OPEN which combined with the automatic and symbolic differentiation and index reduction forms a software with several enhancements, when compared with the popular ones.},

abstract = {The paper presents experimental results concerning dynamic liquid holdup, wetting efficiency and local mass transfer coefficients between the liquid and solid surface in a fixed-bed three-phase reactor, in which both the gas and liquid flow cocurrently downwards. The experiments were conducted for two basic regimes of operation of trickle-bed reactors, namely the gas continuous flow regime and the pulsing flow regime under atmospheric pressure. The measurements of dynamic liquid holdup have been performed for a wide range of gas and liquid flow rates, three different packing diameters, and for two systems of working media of different physical properties. The common correlation developed determines with good accuracy the holdup values in both regimes as well as in the transition region between the two hydrodynamic modes. In experiments concerning the wetting efficiency a dynamic tracer method has been employed, for which an original mathematical model has been formulated. The results are presented in the form of diagrams and appropriate correlating formulae. The experiments concerning local solid—liquid mass transfer coefficients were carried out for two diameters of spherical particles, with the flow rates of both phases and physicochemical properties of the liquid varied over a wide range. The experimental results are correlated and compared with the appropriate literature data. A mathematical model describing the time-varying solid—liquid mass transfer process is formulated for the pulsed flow regime. The time-averaged mass transfer coefficients calculated on the basis of the model developed are compared with the experimental values. A good agreement between these two sets of values fully confirms the assumptions of the model elaborated.},

It includes correlations for determining mass-transfer coefficients, solubility data, and properties of the compounds under process conditions. The model, based on the two-film theory, was tested with regard to the hydrodesulfurization of vacuum gas oil in a new high-pressure pilot plant operated under isothermal conditions. The sulfur content of the product oil was found to depend strongly on the gas/oil flow ratio within the reactor. This is due to the inhibiting effect of hydrogen sulfide on the chemical reaction rates described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. The poor conversion which, in contrast to industrial plants, is often observed in pilot plant reactors can be explained by incomplete catalyst wetting produced by low liquid velocities. The simulation shows a good agreement with the experiments carried out in a wide range of temperature, pressure, space velocity and gas/oil ratio.},

The supported palladium oxide could be reduced to palladium completely in less than one hour at 100°C and 4.5 atm of H2. The sintering of palladium became significant when the reduction temperature was above 300°C. The reaction temperature which gave the maximum pseudo rate constant of hydrogenation increased with increaing pressure. The kinetics of hydrogenation of model compounds, isoprene and styrene, were also studied in a semibatch basket reactor. The increase in hydrogen pressure not only enhances the rate of hydrogenation but also depresses the polymerization of dienes.

A Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type reaction mechanism was proposed for the reaction system, and then a rigorous diffusion-reaction mathematical model was developed. For the egg-shell catalyst particle, the diffusion and reaction of species were described separately in two distinct regions, i.e., the outer active region, where both diffusion and reaction occurred, and the inner inertia region, where only diffusion happened. The kinetic and adsorption parameters were estimated from the diffusion-reaction model with the experimental data. The model was able to describe the experimental observations very well. The simulation results showed that significant concentration gradients existed inside the egg-shell catalyst, which revealed that the influence of the internal diffusion resistances on the reaction kinetics was considerable.},

PYGAS is unstable due to the presence of unsaturated compounds and must be hydrotreated before processing. Two-stage heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation is commonly used to stabilize PYGAS. The First Stage uses a mild trickle-bed conversion for removing very reactive species (styrene and dienes), prior to the more severe Second Stage where sulfured and remaining olefins are converted in gas phase. This work investigates the First Stage of PYGAS hydrotreatment processes with commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The starting point is a data bank of conversion values for hydrogenating runs of synthetic feeds prepared with the representative reactive species in the First Stage scenario. These data were gathered from experimental runs in a short scale unit at pressures near 30 bar, temperatures between 50 and 70°C, and weight hourly spatial velocity (WHSV) from 2h-1 to 70h-1. The data was used for parameter estimation of a kinetic model proposed to the First Stage of PYGAS plants. The obtained model can be employed to develop a computational tool useful in the design and optimization of PYGAS plants.},

For the monolithic reactor a more than 3 times higher volumetric productivity is obtained with much less catalyst. The modeling results indicate that deactivation by gum formation should be significantly less due to much better hydrogen mass transfer in the reactor.},

abstract = {The trickle-bed reactor model proposed by Mostoufi et al. was rebuilt for use in commercial software, Aspen Plus{\textregistered}. Coupling with thirty hydrogenation rate equations, the process model could simulate a pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation unit. With an optimization procedure, the thirty rate constants were obtained after minimizing the relative-concentration-based objective function. In this work, the hydrodynamic parameters including physical properties were simultaneously calculated from the software platform according to the reactor conditions, such as temperature, concentration, etc. Therefore, the effect of parameter variation can be avoided not only along the catalyst bed, but also at the start of run and end of run. This semi-empirical method can be applied to highly exothermic hydrogenation reactor models, and then used it to estimate residue catalyst activity much more theoretically than the weighted average bed temperature method and interpret plant data more in practice, for example, bed temperature profile and its deviation, the relationship between the throughput and pressure drop.},

The results ascertained the success of the proposed modeling in terms of total relative error of about 0.1.

The dynamic liquid holdup and pressure drop values are obviously higher than those measured for air–water system at the same fluid fluxes, reactor pressure and bed temperature due to the surface tension effects.

Good results are obtained, when the liquid-solid and the gas-liquid interactions are modeled separately. Besides the classical Ergun equation, a simple model of the liquid-solid interactions, based on a boundary layer flow is proposed. This approach results in a relation which is very close to the well-known liquid saturation correlation proposed by Specchia and Baldi (1977, Chem. Engng Sci.32, 515–523), and might be its theoretical justification. The gas-liquid interaction is modeled using a drift-flux approach. The different models are tested against the data bank of about 1500 saturation and pressure drop measurements, established mainly by the Nancy research group. The importance of the geometrical characteristics of the porous media and their incomplete description are emphasized. Finally simple predictive correlations based on the models are proposed, tested against the data bank and compared to literature correlations.},

The investigations are focused on a liquid continuous flow regime, the dispersed bubble flow, where the gas is divided into elongated bubbles. Due to the variation of the local flow channel orientation and the local void fraction, the average bubble velocity strongly depends on the local geometry. The flow is more coherent in vertical constrictions, compared to all other types of sites, this is probably due to bubble stagnation in the flow channel enlargements. At a given liquid superficial velocities and for sufficiently high superficial gas velocities, the average bubble size is independent of the gas flow rate; it is of the order of magnitude of the volume of the enlargements of the porous medium. The maximum bubble size is about three times its average size, corresponding thus to the coalescence of three average sized bubbles.},

The flow map experiments are performed in a pilot plant reactor of 0.051m diameter and 1.2m height, with cumene–hydrogen system. A new technique – the acoustic signal measurement – is used for distinguishing between trickle and pulse flow regimes. The effect of operating pressure was investigated in the pressure range of 0.14–2.0MPa. For higher operating pressures, the trickle-to-pulse transition boundary moves towards higher flow rates of both liquid and gas phases. The pressure drop over the reactor bed is increasing with increasing operating pressure and gas/liquid throughputs. The pressure drop results obtained with hydrogen at higher operation pressures match reasonably well the results obtained with air–water at atmospheric pressure. This comparison is made using a new developed pressure drop correlation and illustrates the influence of increased gas density (high operating pressure effect).

The experimental results were compared to correlations from the literature and two new correlations for the pressure drop and the liquid hold-up for non-foaming liquids are proposed; they are based on 1500 experimental results. Consideration of systems exhibiting non-foaming behaviour shows that the two-phase pressure drop is correctly described by the introduction of the modified Lockhart and Martinelli parameter.

Hydrocarbons can be pure compounds or petroleum fractions. Reported petroleum fractions are from gasoline to vacuum residue. The analyzed information was: type of device or cell used to obtain experimental data, model used to predict the VLE behavior, and different options to adjust the EOS by interaction parameters of H2-HC. Comparisons of the ranges of operating conditions (pressure and temperature) of VLE studies with or without reaction were done. The variations of the distribution coefficients of H2 on HC were compared with respect to the pressure. Several of the studies show a strategy used to characterize the oil fraction. It is recognized the importance to consider VLE in the reactor modeling, because it affects the calculation of conversion, depending on the properties of the feedstock and operating conditions. For future work it is recommended to obtain VLE data for H2-heavy petroleum fractions, to development appropriate experimental methods to determine the physical properties of pseudocomponents from heavy petroleum fraction, or mathematical techniques to overcome this deficiency. In addition, the use of analysis of phases' stability in the VLE is suggested to be sure about the number of phases present in the system to obtain more reliable H2-pseudocomponents interaction parameters.},

In this paper a method based on regular solution theory is proposed for prediction of solubility of hydrogen in hydrocarbons, petroleum fractions and coal liquids at different conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen solubility parameter is calculated through solvent type or its molecular weight. Evaluation of results shows that the method can predict solubility data within the same range of accuracy as those calculated from an EOS or other models while this method is simpler and does not require critical properties of solvent which in most cases cannot be estimated accurately. For more than 400 data points and for systems consisting pure hydrocarbons, coal liquid and petroleum fractions the AAD for the proposed model from estimating solubility of hydrogen and Henry's constant for pressures up to 160bar was about 5{\%}. The proposed method is applicable to fractions with molecular weight ranging from 70 to 650 which is equivalent to carbon number ranging from 6 to 46. The temperature and pressure ranges are 283–623K and 1–160bar, respectively. Solubility range is from 0.01 to 26mol{\%}.},

abstract = {The objective of this contribution was to explore the effect of thermodynamic model selection on predicting the solubility of hydrogen in Pyrolysis Gasoline (PYGAS). In order to do this, different combinations of cubic equations of state (EOS), cohesion functions and mixing rules were compared, using both own algorithms and those implemented in the PRO/II 8.0 process simulation software. The models were selected following the recommendations made by some authors for H2 + hydrocarbons systems similar to the studied here. The cubic EOS of Redlich-Kwong (RK) and Peng-Robinson (PR) were considered using: five different cohesion functions, and the classical quadratic mixing rule (CQMR) with five single correla- tions to estimate the binary interaction parameters (BIP). Additionally, the system was simulated with PRO/II employing the Panagiotopoulos-Reid Modified (PA-RE-Mod) and the modified PA-RE mixing rule implemented by SimSci. The results were validated with experimental data reported in the literature for four temperatures 298 K, 313 K, 323 K, 343 K and pressures up to 6MPa. The model composed by the RK EOS, Soave (1993) cohesion function, the CQMR with the BIP calculated with the Gray et al. correlation is the recommended selection to predict the solubility of H2 in PYGAS, under the considered conditions, with a 3.1{\%} AARD (average absolute relative deviation).},

abstract = {The dynamic modeling of an adiabatic hydrocracking reactor was carried out by using the continuous lumping approach. Vacuum gas oil with 30.6°API and normal boiling temperature range from {\~{}}285°C to about 329°C was used as feedstock. Kinetic model parameters were derived from experimental information at three different reactor temperatures: 360, 370, and 380°C; 1–3h−1 LSHV; 356m3/m3 hydrogen-to-oil ratio, and reactor pressure of 5.3MPa. Thermal correlations were chosen to be reliable and dependent on reactivity index. The simulations allowed predicting the dynamic behavior of the reactor regarding temperature and cumulative weight fraction profiles. At the reaction conditions of simulations an increase of almost 10°C was observed in the bed regarding inlet temperature while the reactor position of such maximum was moved to outlet reactor as time-on-stream increased.},
